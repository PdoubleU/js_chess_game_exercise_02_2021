[Lets play a game](starcab.wroclaw.pl)


This old and very popular boardgame, with Indian and Persian origin, has changed over centuries. Today we know moves as 'en passant' or pawn's 'promotions' - both weren't present in the past. The project allows two humans to play on the computer in a browser. This project is still in progress, however, you can play a game (for now the 'en passant' and detecting forbidden move when the king can be checked are unable).

To do:
    'en passant',
    forbidden move for pieces if the move is uncovering the king,
    timer,
    game history
