[Let's play a game](https://pdoubleu.github.io/js_chess_game_exercise_02_2021/)


This old and very popular board game, with Indian and Persian origin, has changed over the centuries. Today we know moves as 'en passant' or pawn's 'promotions' - both weren't present in the past. The project allows two humans to play on the computer in a browser. This project is finished besides one feature: 'check' detection for pieces that are covering king from the 'check'. This feature is not a problem to play a game, but it is present in all modern chess programs. And is helpful for players.
